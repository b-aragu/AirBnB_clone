## General

Welcome to AIRBNB WEBSTATIC folder! This README provides an overview of fundamental concepts related to HTML and CSS.

### What is HTML?

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create the structure of web pages. It consists of a set of elements that define the content and layout of a webpage.

### How to create an HTML page

To create an HTML page, you need to structure the content using HTML elements. An HTML page typically starts with a `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration followed by the `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements.

### What is a markup language

A markup language is a system for annotating text to indicate the structure and presentation of information. HTML is an example of a markup language.

### What is the DOM

The DOM (Document Object Model) is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a document as a tree of objects, allowing scripts to dynamically modify the content and structure of a webpage.

### What is an element / tag

In HTML, an element (or tag) is a part of the markup that defines the structure or behavior of content. Elements are enclosed in opening and closing tags, such as `<p>` for paragraphs.

### What is an attribute

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements and are always included in the opening tag. They are used to configure or modify the element's behavior.

### How does the browser load a webpage

When a browser loads a webpage, it follows a process called rendering. This involves parsing the HTML, creating the DOM, applying CSS styles, and finally displaying the content.

### What is CSS

CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML. It controls the layout, appearance, and formatting of elements on a webpage.

### How to add style to an element

You can add style to an HTML element using CSS by defining rules in a style block or an external stylesheet. For example:

```css
p {
  color: blue;
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

### What is a class

A class is a way to apply a specific style to multiple elements. You can define a class in CSS and then assign it to HTML elements using the `class` attribute.

### What is a selector

A selector in CSS is a pattern used to select and style HTML elements. It defines the elements to which a particular style rule should apply.

### How to compute CSS Specificity Value

CSS specificity determines which style rules take precedence. It is calculated based on the combination of selectors. The higher the specificity value, the more specific the rule.

### What are Box properties in CSS

Box properties in CSS refer to properties that define the layout and dimensions of an element's box model. Examples include `width`, `height`, `margin`, `padding`, and `border`.
